# LED-Name-Badge

Files and resources for making edge lit LED name badges.

Use one of the files above to laser cut an acrylic blank. We recommend using a 1/8th inch clear acrylic.

We have PDF directions for download, as well as videos linked below.

LED Tip: Green, white, and blue LEDs work best. We also like using slow color changing LEDs on occation.

## V2 Name Badge - AKA "Skinny Badge"

This updated version requires a #2 safety pin (or other etching tool), a 5mm clear LED with short legs, a CR2032 battery, and a some stickers to hold it all together.

We find that kids over the age of 10 have no problem with this project, though we recommend that people keep their names 5 letters or less.

## V1 name Badge - AKA "Cross your heart"

Our original badge used two 5mm clear LEDs with long legs, a CR2032 battery, and two paper clips to hold it all together. We found that both kids and adults had issues with the paper clip and LED portion, which is why we designed V2.
